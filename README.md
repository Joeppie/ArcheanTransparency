# ArcheanTransparency

This repository contains quick code (generated by courtesy of ChatGPT) to replace colors of all the blocks on a craft with color 160; this is the "glass" color and will turn the entire craft see-through.
This would be very tedious to do manually on larger constructions and its much quicker this way.

# Usage
Using it, you will need to navigate to where your crafts are stored; this tends to be a location like:
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Archean\Archean-data\client\blueprints\mycraft.json` it makes sense to save the resulting output from the tool under a new name, or the same name, if you're okay with not having a bcakup.
The game will instnatly

# More Info
For the curious that chatGPT prompt used was 

> I have a json structure and in various places there is an array named colors, which is simple a list of integer numbers, and I want each number to be replaced by the number 160. Can you write me a function to do so? Also generate an html page that calls the function on the text in an input and outputs it to a field next to it

I am a programmer, and I could have written this the old fashioned way, but it would have taken longer, and instead I spent that time on making this tool available on Github.. which ChatGPT also helped me do a bit quicker.
